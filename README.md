# Database Migration Tool for Delphi Developers

## About the Project

This project aims to provide a free application that helps the Delphi community with database migration systems and auto-generate models to your project.
It is built by coping what [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) and [Knex.js](https://knexjs.org/) do for Node.js.

You can support this project by contributing to our list of database driver repositories.

### Currently Supported Drivers:
- **MSSQL 2019** (Microsoft SQL Server)
- **Firebird 5.0**
- **SQLite 3**

## How to Contribute

If you would like to support the project, we welcome your help! Here are a few ways you can contribute:
- Implement additional database drivers.
- Report issues or suggest improvements.
- Create documentation to help other developers.
